📦 Parking Lot Vehicle Counter

A lightweight client–server system for detecting and counting vehicles in parking lot images using YOLOv8.

🚀 Overview

This project is a complete, deployable system that uses Computer Vision + Networking to recognize vehicles in parking lot images and return the total vehicle count.
It supports:

REST API (/count)

Web interface for uploading images

Mobile access over local Wi-Fi / Hotspot

Annotated output images generated by YOLOv8

Clean and responsive UI

This project was built as part of a networking course and demonstrates how AI models can be deployed as real-world services.

🧠 Features

✔ YOLOv8 vehicle detection (car, truck, bus, motorcycle)
✔ Flask-based server with REST endpoints
✔ Web dashboard for uploading images
✔ Client-side Python script for testing
✔ Mobile network support (connect from a phone to the server via local network)
✔ Annotated output images saved on server
✔ Clean, modular, readable code

🖼 Web Interface

The web UI is simple, clean, and mobile-friendly.
Users can upload a parking image and instantly get:

Total vehicle count

Annotated preview image (saved on server)

🔥 How to Run the Server
1. Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

2. Run the server
python server.py

Server will start on:
http://0.0.0.0:5000/
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
http://<your-local-IP>:5000/   (access from your phone)

📱 Using From Mobile

Connect laptop + phone to same Wi-Fi or Hotspot

Open browser on phone

Navigate to:

http://<your-laptop-IP>:5000/


Upload an image → Get detection result

🧪 Python Client Example
import requests

url = "http://<your-ip>:5000/count"
image_path = "test.jpg"

with open(image_path, "rb") as img:
    response = requests.post(url, files={"image": img})

print(response.json())

🧩 YOLO Model
